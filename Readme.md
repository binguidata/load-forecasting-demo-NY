Demo: NYC Electricity Load Forecasting Application
===

This application showcases how the rorodata platform can be used as an end to end service for data science deployments. Here we showcase how to:
1. Pull publicly available data from sources
2. Pass the data through a feature engineering pipeline.
3. Train a machine learning model on the engineered features.
4. Deploy the trained model as an API


Dataset:
===
We use publicly available weather and electricity load data for the state of New York.

The electricity data can be found at [here](http://mis.nyiso.com/public/) under Real time actual load.
